He had the unusual idea of becoming really good at writing eulogies to help people part. \n\nIt's sad how we cope with the pointlessness of death by pretending it's just another part of life.\n\nMy eulogies would be about how unfair it is that you had to go. How unnecessary it is to stop experiencing. How we're born probably just a century too early. How there's enough resources for so many more of us. How so many of us just don't dare to think big enough.\n\nSeriously, fuck death. Life is so precious. \n\nI'm hoping longevity escape velocity hits sooner than expected. We don't have to lose anyone.

So here it is now. It's aged well. \n\nWe still have no intentions of buying Maseratis, Max' hair is much more grey and mine gone. \n\nI hope Matt and Nick are happy that their trust led to much more exciting stuff coming out of EA Geneva. \n\nAnd I'm grateful to still be just as excited as when I read that confirmation email.
