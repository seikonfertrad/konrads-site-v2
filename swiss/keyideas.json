    "summary": "we need to simultaneously pursue technological solutions and modify culture toward what actually matters — walking a tightrope between both. hyperstition is the key mechanism: act as if a better world is already emerging, and the acting helps make it real. but this only works if grounded in good faith — assuming others share the goal even when their methods differ. without good faith you get cynicism; without cultural realignment you get tech solutionism; without technology you get wishful thinking. the trick is holding all three at once.",
