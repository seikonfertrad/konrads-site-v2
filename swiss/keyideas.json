    "summary": "most problems that look like knowledge problems or resource problems are actually coordination problems. we often know what to do. we frequently have what we need. what's missing is the ability to get enough people aligned, trusting, and acting in concert. and when we genuinely don't know what to do, the way forward is tinkering — and tinkering is, as proto-industrial britain shows, largely a question of social status. people need to feel safe experimenting and having bets not pay off. the practical answer to coordination failures is better infrastructure: better tools, better protocols, better shared languages. we need to be far more ambitious about building this infrastructure and grant status to those who do so systematically.",

    "title": "bounded rationality",
    "summary": "herbert simon's core insight: humans don't optimize, they satisfice. we decide with incomplete information, finite time, and limited cognition. this isn't a flaw — it's the operating condition. kahneman treats this as systematic error to be corrected. gigerenzer gets closer: heuristics are adaptive compressions, not bugs. and since everything is trade-offs under bounded rationality, 'correcting' one bias means degrading performance somewhere else in the system. you can find better compressions — better heuristics — but you can't magically debias your way to optimality. two people with identical values will still reach different conclusions because they're working from different slices of reality. stop asking 'why don't people just...' and start designing for how people actually think.",

    "title": "no fundamental value differences",
    "summary": "most apparent value clashes aren't deep disagreements — they're artefacts of bounded rationality, polysemy (the same words meaning different things to different people), impatience to bridge inferential gaps, and two-level games where claiming incommensurable values is strategically useful for in-group cohesion. strip away the noise and people want remarkably similar things: safety, dignity, agency, belonging. the solution is better negotiation infrastructure — what seb krier calls coasean bargaining at scale: reducing the transaction costs that prevent us from actually hashing things out. most 'disagreements' dissolve when people sit long enough to adjust for subjective context. this applies at every scale — not just between nations, but between departments, subcultures, generations, any boundary where in-group and out-group form.",
