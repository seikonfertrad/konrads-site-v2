# Updated Beliefs / Lessons I Had to Learn — future section

Roam graph scan completed 2026-02-20. Candidate entries:

1. **veganism → pragmatic nutrition** — was vegan 3 years, concluded it "muddies epistemics" and is "an overupdate." meat makes reliable nutrition easier; principled stances bad in VUCA world. (Dec 2022, already partially in funfacts)

2. **scout mindset doesn't hold under bounded rationality** — revisited Galef's framing, concluded "it doesn't actually work that well in a world of bounded rationality." (Oct 2025)

3. **comfort → complacency as the real threat** — not comfort itself but the quiet decision to stop reaching. (already on site as cold take + hot take)

4. **polyamory → neither poly nor mono is good actually** — from strong poly advocate to concluding the framework itself is wrong. Mari's insight: "you have the illusion of exploring but are in reality just repeating the same mistakes." (Feb 2024)

5. **direct feedback without tact damages more than it helps** — being right isn't enough, need to make space for others to arrive at the same place. Self-identified "bug" of making people feel judged when probing. (Jan 2022, Oct 2024, Sep 2024)

6. **aphantasia shapes everything more than initially thought** — affects emotional attachment, romantic relationships, learning style, craving patterns, empathy. Hard cut-off in caring; emotions "stuck in the present." (Feb 2022 Silvana insight, ongoing)

7. **activism doesn't work (the way most people do it)** — Turkey in early 2010s taught this, "similar to going vegan." Pivoted toward institutions and infrastructure. (Jan 2024)

8. **institutional culture eats strategy** — SI lessons: institutional memory insufficient, people dwell on past, scarcity makes people stupider, fix is pockets of competence. Thick skin to preserve optimism. (Mar 2023)

9. **you can't just educate your way out of problems** — "we can't just educate everybody on every issue." bounded rationality means better infrastructure, not better arguments. (Oct 2020)

10. **high school made you a bad person** — no challenge, no bar, learned to see grownups as lame. Never learned to grind. Took a decade to understand. (Dec 2021, Sep 2024)

## Next steps
- Pick entries that add something new (vs overlap with existing cold/hot takes)
- Decide on section name and tone
- Consider backlinks feature (Roam-style person pages) as companion feature
