i've been writing in fragments for years — twitter threads, substack posts, roam notes, drawers on my personal site. none of it felt like it belonged anywhere permanent.

so i'm adding a blog to [konrads.link](https://konrads.link). the map is still there (it's the homepage), but now there's also a place for longer-form thinking.

## what to expect

mostly writing about:

- **ai governance** — the inferential gaps between builders, policymakers, and publics
- **community building** — what i'm learning from fractalgva and a decade of organizing
- **personal epistemics** — how i think about thinking, updated beliefs, coordination problems
- **building in public** — occasionally, how this site itself works

no schedule, no promises. just writing when something's ready.
