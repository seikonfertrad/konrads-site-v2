  "intro": "co-founder of the <a href=\"https://simoninstitute.ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">simon institute for longterm governance</a>. we do frontier ai diplomacy—helping china and the west exchange on ai governance so that frontier r&d is understood across geopolitical fault-lines.",
  "details": [
    "in practice: we brief diplomats and international civil servants, connect them to technical experts, and contribute to official documents via trust networks across countries' missions and international organisations' secretariats. the goal is productive communication between the people building the most powerful technology in history and the people tasked with governing it—across countries that don't (yet) believe they have shared goals.",
    "we started in biosecurity—organizing side events at the biological weapons convention, running tabletop exercises, modelling pandemic attention dynamics. when covid validated our focus on catastrophic risks, we launched the institute. when chatgpt validated our focus on ai, we went all in. now a team of 10, chf 5m+ raised, operating at the intersection of technical governance and intercultural exchange."
